# Europeana tools

This is a Python library to interact with various Europeana APIs. This library is not only heavily built around RDF and LUCENE but also uses parts of Europeana APIs that aren't necessarily publicly documented. Breaking changes will occur. The library is however battle-tested to say the least. Oh, and it has built-in support for things like cache, SPARQL, HTTP-HEAD lookups, HTTP-POST search queries and much more.

## Installation

By design, the library is contained in a single file so you can just grab it and lean back. If that isn't your thing you can install it from pypi:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Abbe98/europeana-py.git
```

## Documentation

Sorry.
